# Carthage - FHIR-based GraphQL Architecture

Carthage is an open-source FHIR GraphQl architecture supported and developed by Inception Labs.

## Structure

The project is structured as the following:

- **src/resources**: The folder contains the official GraphQL definition of all FHIR resources avaible [online](http://build.fhir.org/downloads.html). The current FHIR version is `4.5.0`. 

## FHR Resources

FHIR Resources are logicially organized into 3 main subgroups.

- `input`: TBD
- `primitive`: Custom primitives for FHIR resources.
- `schema`: TBD 

## Schema-first apporach

We decided to follow a Schema-First apporach to design our GraphQL architecture.

## Why this project?
